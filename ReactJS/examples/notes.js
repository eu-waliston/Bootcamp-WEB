      "Avoid scribbling everything that is being said (or everything that is on the slides) word for word.

But if like me, you’re not confident in your ability to draw, don’t be too quick to dismiss the use of drawing in your notes. By drawing our notes, we are forced to not just passively take down the information word for word but to process the information and translate them into our own sketches",
