        <p class="about__me">
          I'm Waliston from Brazil, an information systems student and a JavaScript Full Stack Developer Jr, I've been spend a lot time in my studies and planning my future as a developer, and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
          
          Iâ€™m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.
